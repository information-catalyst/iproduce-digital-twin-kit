The Digital Twin Development Tool enables the users to develop digital models/twins of physical entities. 

These models will allow OpIS users to develop, design, and deliver learning and training material using advanced digital technologies. 
Using a digital twin, activities can be simulated on a small scale and learn before they are used on a large scale without wasting any resources or damaging any equipment.

A Digital Twin can execute synthetic scenarios as part of training and support learning activities.
